# The Cold War

- 50 years after World War II, the United States vs the Soviet Union
- Two major breakthroughs: high-speed jet aircraft and the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)
- Chuck Yeager’s Bell X-1 achieved the first supersonic flight in October 1947

# 1953

After the breaking of sonic speed on

- F-100
- MiG-19

People see the potential of commercial supersonic airline.

# In the Pass

```mermaid

    title PAN AM 1960 – Cost Breakdown
    "Flight operations"        : 26
    "Maintenance"              : 24
    "Passenger services"       : 18
    "Air traffic & navigation" : 12
    "Other"                    : 20
```

Fuel cost is so low. Not even showing in finical report.

# Right Now

    "Air traffic & navigation" : 9
    "Other"                    : 9

Flight operations = Fuel + Workers Payout

* The "Patchwork Philosophy" of Engines
  *  Rolls-Royce designed a variable inlet for the Concorde
  *  this system required real-time computer control

# Highlights

* The Concorde's "supersonic cruise" capability (2.04 Mach) and "breaking the Earth's rotational speed"
* The Tu-144's "high fuel consumption" and "small winglets" design were crude, but it was the first to achieve supersonic commercial flight

::right::

# Failures

* Material choices limited the Concorde's maximum speed (2179 km/h), while the Tu-144's structural weakness led to a crash at the Paris Air Show
* The complexity of the mechanical systems made maintenance costs extremely high, ultimately making it a symbol of "luxury aviation."

* The "Double-edged Sword" of Economy and Market
* The "Invisible Driver" of Politics and the Cold War
* The "Invisible Barrier" of Society and Culture

* Non-technical Lessons:
  * Even the most advanced technology will fail if it cannot solve economic viability and public acceptance
  * Projects driven by Cold War politics often ignore commercial logic

# The "Double-edged Sword" of Economy and Market

- **The "Deadly Strike" of Oil Prices**: From low prices in 1950s to 8x cost increase after 1970s crisis
- **The "Bubble" of Ticket Prices**: 20x price premium with limited passenger numbers

# The "Invisible Driver" of Politics and the Cold War

- **De Gaulle's "Political Gamble"**: National prestige over commercial logic
- **US "Regulatory Barrier"**: Banned from domestic routes
  - Due to sonic boom
  - Or political reason

# The "Invisible Barrier" of Society and Culture

- **Noise and Environment Controversy**: Sonic boom protests
- **Public Safety Crisis**: 2000 crash damaged trust

# Risk Assessment and the Safety Dilemma

* Main Risks:
  * Fuel system explosion risk
  * Structural failure risk
  * Chain reaction of accidents

* Risk Response Strategies:
  * Material upgrades (abandoned titanium)
  * Safety redundancy design
  * Policy avoidance measures

* Risk Warning:
  * Combination of technical and human risks proved unsustainable

# Risk Response Strategies

- **Material Upgrade**: Titanium alloy rejected due to cost
- **Safety Redundancy**: Fuel isolation layers added post-2000
- **Policy Avoidance**: Restricted to transatlantic routes

# Technical Redesign

* Improving Materials
* Addressing the Fuel Tank

# Non-Technical Redesign

* Many aeronautical organizations tend to cut corners which lead to disaster
* Inclusivity: if we can’t safely operate it, no innovation matters
